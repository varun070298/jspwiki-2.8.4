How to translate JSPWiki to your language and get away with it?
===============================================================

JSPWiki translations are in three files, all located in the etc/i18n directory.
The files are:

* CoreResources.properties - this is the main file for JSPWiki core components
  (e.g. errors, and that sort of stuff)
  
* templates/default.properties - this is the property file for the default template.
  All other template localizations go into this one as well.
  
* plugin/PluginResources.properties - the file where all the JSPWiki core plugins
  (that is, the ones that ship with JSPWiki) get their translations from.
  
You will need to provide all three files.  In addition - if you are very enterprising -
you can also provide an extra translation (but this is strictly optional):
the corepages.  They are located under src/wikipages/<language>.

The following is a simple tutorial for creating the files.  However, if you are
computationally adept, it's a much nicer idea to just copy the default template
files by hand and send us a patch.

Step 1
------

Create the necessary template files by running

% ant i18n-create-template

This will ask your language code (e.g. "se" if you wish to make a Swedish translation).
This code is the standard ISO two-letter language code for your language.  If you want,
you can also make a language variant version (e.g. "en_AU" for Australian English).

The files will be saved in your current directory, under "i18n_templates/JSPWiki_<language>/"

Step 2
------

Translate the files.  Do not forget that the property files MUST be in ISO-Latin-1,
so you may need to use the native2ascii tool to munge the files first.

Step 3
------

Test the files.  Create a JAR file with

% ant i18n-jar-template

Which will create a build/JSPWiki_se.jar, which you can then put into the classpath of
a live JSPWiki installation to check.

Please try to be thorough.

Step 4
------

Contribute the translation back to JSPWiki.  Please go to the Apache issue tracker at

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JSPWIKI

and create a new ticket; then attach the JAR file to the ticket.  Please have a 
separate zip/JAR file for your wikipages translation; makes them easier to keep
track of them.  Of course, if you know how, adding a patch is even better!

REMEMBER TO TELL WHICH VERSION OF JSPWIKI YOUR TRANSLATION WAS MADE FOR!

Note: we don't necessarily take in translations for older versions.

Step 5
------

The most important step of all: Please, please, PLEASE maintain your translation!  Even
though JSPWiki development is multilingual, we don't know all the languages, so sooner
or later your translation will be obsolete.

However, we have a nifty tool for checking what needs to be updated in a translation!
Run

% ant i18n-check

And it will tell you what is obsolete, and what you will need to update.

If you see something that is not up to date or plain wrong, please go again to the 
Apache issue tracker at

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JSPWIKI

Open a ticket, and attach a patch for your translation. Again, REMEMBER TO TELL WHICH
VERSION OF JSPWIKI!

Doing a patch is easy - if you use Eclipse, just right-click on the project, and choose
"Team->Create Patch".  Then attach the patch file to the JIRA issue.

If you have trouble creating a patch, then you can upload the changed files themselves,
but with two caveats

1) please say that you don't know how to create a patch, and
2) this is OK only for language translations.

Step 6
------

Have a cup of coffee and relax.  Relaxations are very important, says Zathras.
